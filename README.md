# Experimental tools and artifacts for a research on: Fitness landscape analysis of hyrbid (soft/rigid) robot evolution

This repo includes the tools and the artifacts needed for replicating the results of an experimental research on *the impact of softness on the ruggedness of the fitness landscape in the evolutionary optimization of hybrid (soft/rigid) legged robots*.

## Dependencies

This project depends on:
- [2d-robot-evolution](https://github.com/ericmedvet/2d-robot-evolution) v0.3.2, which in turn depends on:
  - [JGEA](https://github.com/ericmedvet/jgea) v2.2.1
  - [2-D Multi Robot Simulator (2D-MR-Sim)](https://github.com/ericmedvet/2dmrsim)
- Java SDK 18
- R (with some appropriate tools)

## Overview of the experimental phases

### Phase 1: evolution

### Phase 2: search space walks

### Phase 3: data analysis
